## How to Use This Workflow (Download)

1. Refer to the tutorial for detailed instructions on acquiring the necessary resources.
2. Download the workflow and associated resources, such as videos, to follow along with the tutorial.
3. Install custom nodes using the custom manager.
4. Install required models, including checkpoints, ControlNet, and AnimateDiff.
5. Update ComfyUI and restart.
6. Verify that the models are correctly loaded by checking that their names match your model names.
7. Conduct a test run with a low number of frames (e.g., 16) to ensure everything is functioning correctly.
8. Adjust settings, change models, add ControlNets, incorporate IP Adapters, etc., until you achieve satisfactory results.
9. Run the complete animation, keeping an eye on VRAM usage, particularly with RAVE KSampler.

## Tips for Using This Workflow

- This workflow is configured to work with AnimateDiff version 3. For other versions, it is unnecessary to use the Domain Adapter (Lora). Simply deactivate or bypass the Lora Loader node.
- While unsampling originally operates with Depth, utilizing LooseDepth enables greater transformation of objects and scenes.
- The workflow functions well with controlnets besides ControlGIF.
- Applying IP Adapter with the first image generated from the RAVE KSampler yields consistent results.
- Efforts to integrate smoothly with SDXL are ongoing; any suggestions or tricks are welcome.
- Note that RAVE KSampler also consumes significant VRAM. With SD1.5 type videos, processing 96 frames was achieved using a 4090 24 GB GPU.
